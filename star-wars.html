                Some empires fell while other countries rose to power. World war i shook the landscape of the world as we knew it. For those keeping count, we’re now up to 11 star wars feature films: Many battles were fought around the world with volunteers and enlisted soldiers. A long time ago, in a galaxy far far way, millions of moviegoers were taken for an adventure of a lifetime. Located on the national mall in washington, d.c., the vietnam veterans memorial pays homage to all of the united states armed forces personnel who fought and were killed or are missing in action in the vietnam war. No matter how much distance you put between the past and the present, there always seems to be more than a few famous faces that resemble the iconic looks of the stars of yesteryear. In 1979, a vietnam veteran started the vietnam veterans memorial fund with plans to create a place for vietnam war veterans to gather and express their grief as part of the healing process.
