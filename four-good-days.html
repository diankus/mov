        <p>Many restaurants are open on christmas day and even offer special meals and deals to patrons. The word “breakfast” comes from the action of “breaking the fast” that occurs overnight after your last meal of the day and continues until you eat the next morning. Veterans day is one of the eleven federal holidays in the united states for federal organizations and is a public holiday for all 50 states.</p>

        <p>Veteran&#039;s day is an important observance in the united states, set aside for honoring and remembering men and women who have served in the armed forces. I&#039;m off from the day job today to celebrate a momentous occasion: After all of the hustle and bustle leading up to christmas the last thing many people want to worry about is cooking on the big day.</p>
