    <p>Watching disney films is like a rite of passage as a child. Look to hollywood films for major inspiration. If you&#039;re ready for a fun night out at the movies, it all starts with choosing where to go and what to see. Anyone who has even a casual knowledge of films can name at least a few bad movies, but as fans, we tend to assume the actors were happy to do the work. As much as people complain about the lack of creativity in hollywood, they will still line up around the block to see a remake of a popular flick.</p>
