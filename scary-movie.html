    <p>If you&#039;re ready for a fun night out at the movies, it all starts with choosing where to go and what to see. Here are the best ways to find a movie. Unfortunately for moviemakers, their mistakes are often caught on camera and not so easy to erase or forget. Movies can evoke a wide array of different emotions — happiness, fear, excitement, sadness — and if they&#039;re really well done, emotional investment in the films’ characters is something you enjoy as part of the overall experience. If you&#039;re interested in the latest blockbuster from disney, marvel, lucasfilm or anyone else making great popcorn flicks, you can go to your local theater and find a screening coming up very soon.</p>
